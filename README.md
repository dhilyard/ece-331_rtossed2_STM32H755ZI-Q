A very basic operating system written for my ECE-331 course. It focuses on the functions of the operating system controlling resources and managing processes, as such the processes that it controls are quite simple. They are a terminal that gives a word count for entered text and a number of blinking LEDs on different processes. The code was written in C with inline assembly and built with Makefiles.
